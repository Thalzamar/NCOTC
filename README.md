# NCOUTO
Nuclearcraft Overhauled: Unrealistic Turbine Overhaul

Requires Nuclearcraft:Overhauled version 2o.3.4 or newer.

Download the Repository as .zip and place the recource and script folders in your Minecraft instance.

This uses the ContentTweaker integration of Nuclearcraft: Overhauled to add 32 new Turbine Coils, 6 new Rotor-Blades and 2 new Stators.

7 additional coils are enabled for use and crafting when [QMD](https://github.com/lach01298/QMD/) is installed.

Please read the Wiki page for a short overview of what has been added.

These Coils are for people who want some extra free energy from their turbine, don't expect a giant increase in Coil-Efficiency.

The new Stators and Blades may be better than the default but in large Turbines Radiation may become a problem.

For using the custom blades & stators in [Kurtchekov's Turbine Calculator](https://github.com/Kurtchekov/TurbineCalculator/releases) replace the native Turbine Calculator.json with the one found in the here, don't use every part at the same time else the Calculator may break and it takes forever. Choose carefully what you want to use and experiment to get the best for your Turbine size.

The .ncpf file named "NCOUTO" contains all the blades, stators and coils added by this addon to be used in [Thiz's Reactor Generator](https://github.com/ThizThizzyDizzy/nc-reactor-generator). Load this .ncpf file into the "Load Configuration" and you will be able to test all the coils and blades from this addon!
