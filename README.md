Nuclearcraft Overhauled: Unrealistic Turbine Overhaul

this uses the ContentTweaker integration of Nuclearcraft:Overhauled to add 32 new Turbine Coils, 6 new Rotor-Blades and 2 new Stators.

Please read the Customparts information.txt for a short overview what has been added.

These Coils are for people who want some extra free energy from their turbine, don't expect a giant increase in Coil-Efficiency.

Remember that while the blades may be an upgrade they still release radiation, also when using Kurketchovs Turbine Calculator limit the parts you want to use,else it takes forever to calculate.
